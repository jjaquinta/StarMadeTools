# StarMadeTools
Tools for the StarMade game

## SMEdit
The SMEdit tool is for doing off-line editing of StarMade space ships and other artifacts.
The 1.0 code stream can be found here: https://github.com/StarMade/SMEditClassic

This repository is for the 1.2 code stream. The feature set is reduced to editing starships only.
The primary goal is to be able to import 3D definition files and create basic hulls based on these.
This will be in the smd2 data file format, which is no longer actively supported by StarMade.
However, it can be upgraded upon import to the modern StarMade.

Should StarMade support and document an external format at some point, a 2.0 stream will be started.
